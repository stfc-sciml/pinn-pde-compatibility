# PINN-PDE-compatibility

This repository is a supplementary material of the following paper:


*Kuangdai Leng, and Jeyan Thiyagalingam. On the compatibility between a neural network and a partial differential equation for physics-informed learning. arXiv preprint [arXiv:????.????](????), 2022.*

### Installation
`Pytorch` is the only dependency of this code. Installation of `Pytorch` can be found 
[here](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/). You do not need a GPU to run the scripts provided here.

### Running the scripts
Three Python scripts are provided here.

* `relu_causes_zero_hessian.py` verifies that a multilayer
perceptron (MLP) only with ReLU-like activation functions will always lead to a 
vanished Hessian;
* `piecewise_linear_by_relu.py` plots a few piecewise linear functions generated by a few ReLU-based MLPs as a support to the sketch in Figure 2b in the paper;
* `out_layer_hyperplane.py` implements the out-layer-hyperplane in an MLP for a 2D inhomogeneous wave equation on a membrane, $u_{xx} + u_{yy} − u_{tt} − u_{t} = \sin(x + y − t)$, following Algorithm 1 in the paper.
